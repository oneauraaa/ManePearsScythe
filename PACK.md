# ManePear's Scythe Texture Pack Setup Guide
Due to the pack we are using is under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 License, we cannot include it within the plugin.

## How to setup the texture pack:
1. [Download](https://github.com/oneauraaa/ManePearsScythe/raw/refs/heads/master/scythe.zip) the scythe.zip file.
2. Go to mc-packs.net [Here](https://mc-packs.net/).
3. Upload the scythe.zip file to the website.
4. It should give you a SHA1 and a link. 
5. Go to the plugin's config.yml file and paste the SHA1 and link in the corresponding sections.
