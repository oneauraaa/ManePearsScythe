# ManePear's Scythe Texture Pack Setup Guide
Due to the pack we are using is under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 License, we cannot include it within the plugin.

## How to setup the texture pack:
1. Go to mc-packs.net [Here](https://mc-packs.net/).
2. Upload the scythe.zip file (in the repository) to the website.
3. It should show you a SHA1 and a link. 
4. Go to the plugin's config.yml file and paste the SHA1 and link in the corresponding sections.
